# vidswap

Vidswap was created to replace the deck startup video file with a file of the user's choice.

When ./vidswap/vidswap.sh is run, it reads all files within the 'vids' folder and displays a numbered list of the files.

The user then enters the number corresponding to the video they want to put into place.

The selected video file should then play every time the steam deck enters gaming mode.

# Credits

HUGE credit to /u/DerpinHerps for their amazing startup videos and work pioneering the process.

Vidswap is basically just a scripted version of the process they identified.
